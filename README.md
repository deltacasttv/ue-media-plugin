# DELTACAST's I/O cards UNREAL ENGINE Media Plugin

> Live media in and out of the Unreal Engine with DELTACAST’s professional video cards.


The DELTACAST UNREAL ENGINE (EU) Plugin offers direct support of DELTACAST’s video cards into the Unreal Engine, allowing live video capture from a DELTACAST’s card input ports to the Unreal Engine; and sending rendered video output from the Unreal Engine out to an output port of a DELTACAST’s video card.

Augmented reality experiences — mixing traditional 2D video with real-time 3D environments — are becoming increasingly in demand for film and broadcast media applications. This plugin allows to make the Unreal Engine work as a seamless part of a video production pipeline using DELTACAST’s professional quality video cards. 

Typical applications of UE with DELTACAST’s cards :  
* Play professional-level video live in the Unreal Engine, composited into the virtual 3D world on the fly.
* Apply effects to the imported video directly in the Unreal Engine, like chroma-keying, lens undistortion, color correction, and more.
* Synchronize the Unreal Engine with the timecode and frame rate of your input video, to eliminate timing issues.
* Render video feeds from the Unreal Editor or from your running game project back out to your studio's video pipeline.
